# Compiler

Mini compiler that can compile .mcpp source code into machine language and turn it into an
executable.

## Usage

1. On command line, use the `compile.bat` or `./compile` to compile the source
2. Change the PL1.mcpp or PL2.mcpp or PL3.mcpp: (You can also create your own .mcpp file)
3. Execute in CMD/Terminal by going to the src directory and entering in CMD/Terminal `mcompiler.exe PL1.mcpp PL1.exe` or `./mcompiler PL1.mcpp Pl1.exe`: 
the PL1.exe is the desired executable to be run (You can choose your own filename for this)
